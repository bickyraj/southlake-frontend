                    Southlake Diagnostics, 580 Commerce Street, Suite 150A, Southlake TX 76092</p>

                    <p>Invitation to Participate: You are being asked to take part in a research study that will determine the levels of antibodies against the virus that causes Covid-19. Antibodies are the compounds your body produces following vaccination that neutralizes the virus, and prevents you from getting the disease. Before you decide to participate in this study, it is important that you understand why the research is being done and what it will involve. Please read the following information carefully. Please ask if there is anything that is not clear or words that you do not understand.</p>
                <p>Purpose of the Research: After you have been vaccinated against Covid-19, relatively little information is available about how long the vaccination will be effective and how various factors might affect the ability of the vaccine to protect you. Your participation will aid us in determining: (1) the lowest levels of antibodies that may protect against the disease; (2) when the highest levels of antibodies are produced after vaccination; (3) the change in antibody levels (at approximately 3, 6, and 9 months and annually, or until the sponsor ends the study) following vaccination; and (4) information regarding the effects of age, gender, and various diseases and drugs on the antibody levels.</p>
                <p>The antibody assays being used in this research have not been approved by the Food and Drug Administration and are considered investigational.</p>
                <p>Voluntary Participation: Taking part in this research study is totally your choice. You can decide to refuse to participate in this study or to stop taking part in this study at any time for any reason. If you refuse to participate in the study or stop being in this research study, it will not affect your care or treatment outside this study. There will be no penalty or loss of benefits to which you are otherwise entitled.</p>
                <p>Description of Procedures: A small amount of blood (less than one teaspoonful) will be taken from a vein in your arm or hand for our analysis. The blood collection procedures will be performed by a trained phlebotomist with sterile supplies involving standard procedures. Over the first year after vaccination, a blood sample will be drawn every three months. Unused parts of each blood sample will be retained for 2 weeks and then discarded.</p>
                <p>We will also review your medical history and information, as well as information such as your age, gender, and previous or current health issues at the time blood samples are collected that may influence your antibody levels.</p>
                <p>Risks and Inconveniences: The blood draw procedure involves a quick "stick" with a small needle which may cause a short period of discomfort and potential bruising and bleeding afterwards. Therefore, the chance of swelling or infection is minimal. If any issues occur, you will be taken care of.</p>
                <p>Benefits: The primary benefit to you will be knowing how high your antibodies are with time after vaccinations. In addition, the knowledge to be gained from the research is of potential use to you and others as we determine what factors might influence your resistance to getting Covid-19.</p>
                <p>Alternatives to Participation: This is not a treatment study. Your alternative is to not participate.</p>
                <p>Confidentiality: The information we collect for this research project will be kept confidential. No one but the researchers will be able to see it. Any information about you will be given a number instead of your name, and only the researchers will know your number which will not be shared by anyone else. Your private information and your medical record will be shared with individuals and organizations that conduct or watch over this research, including:</p>
