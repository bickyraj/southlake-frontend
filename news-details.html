                    <h3>William J. Kraemer, PhD<br><span>CSCS,*D, FNSCA<br>Scientific Board Co-Chair</span></h3>
                    <p>Dr. Kraemer, during his career, managed and directed a diverse and incredible range of research portfolios over the past 35 years in Division I research institutions including The Ohio State University, and the Pennsylvania State University and University of Connecticut. His prior research as an officer in the U.S. Army gave him insights into the challenges of military service and the need for training and recovery methods to cope with stress.</p>
                    <p>His laboratory groups and their scientific collaborators have taken on various problems related to exercise training and recovery in men and women in military and athletic populations and the interventions that can enhance performance. They have examined nutritional interventions as an important tool for enhancing performance, health, and recovery. From basic cellular studies examining muscular and endocrine effects of microgravity and pituitary cell function to hypertrophy from exercise training, animal models have provided basic findings for human studies.</p>
                    <p>His work in sports medicine and sports science has led to him being named one of the top sport scientists in the world. A wide span of subject populations from children to older adults have been involved with these studies with an emphasis on women’s health including breast cancer. One of his primary lines of research has been directed toward the understanding of resistance exercise and training and its programming for health, fitness, and high-performance training. Using the latest laboratory techniques in neuroscience, neuromuscular and endocrine sciences have led to important discoveries and solutions to problems. Together the integration of systems physiology and multi-disciplinary teams have provided his long-standing approach to scientific investigation.</p>
                    <p>With more than 500 peer-reviewed scientific publications, 12 books and more than 60,000 citations on Harzing’s Publish or Perish lists, his scholarly impact has been impressive. An honorary doctorate from the University of Jyväskylä in Finland in 2016 also demonstrated the worldwide influence of his research. His research has garnered millions of dollars of external funding from federal, corporate and institute funding sources.</p>
